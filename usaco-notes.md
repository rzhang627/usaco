# USACO Notes

## Bronze

- Coming up with solutions to the problems I've attempted thus far is not the challenge; rather, the process of implementing the solution in C++ has been the most demanding, as I am still unfamiliar with the language

## Problem-Solving Strategies

- Ensuring a complete understanding of the problem statement is the first step in problem solving

## Debugging

- When debugging, the most common type of error I've encountered thus far is usually an incorrect implementation of correct logic
    - Be patient and think through your logic thoroughly
- In the problem Cow Gymnastics from USACO 2019 December (Bronze), the only error was not using `freopen()` before using the command `cin`, so make sure to double check the sequence and relative ordering of instructions executed
- Double check which indices you are using to index vectors and arrays
